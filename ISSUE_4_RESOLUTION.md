# Issue #4 Resolution: SFP Write Protocol Implementation

## Summary

Issue #4 "Investigate SFP Write Protocol via BLE" has been **successfully resolved**. The BLE write protocol has been reverse-engineered, documented, and fully implemented in the SFP vault application.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Complete BLE API Documentation
Created comprehensive documentation in `docs/BLE_API_SPECIFICATION.md` covering:
- All BLE service and characteristic UUIDs
- Six discovered API endpoints with full request/response schemas
- Write protocol flow with chunking details
- Implementation examples in JavaScript
- Safety warnings and testing recommendations

### 2. Full Write Functionality Implementation
Updated `frontend/script.js` with:
- ✅ Correct BLE UUIDs (no longer placeholders)
- ✅ Complete `writeSfp()` function with chunking and progress tracking
- ✅ Safety confirmation dialogs with warnings
- ✅ Error handling and detailed logging
- ✅ Post-write verification guidance

### 3. Enhanced Status & Version Monitoring
Implemented real-time device monitoring:
- ✅ Automatic firmware version detection on connection
- ✅ Version compatibility warnings
- ✅ Periodic status checks (every 5 seconds)
- ✅ SFP module presence detection
- ✅ Battery level parsing

### 4. Improved Read Functionality
Updated read operations to use discovered endpoint:
- ✅ Changed from placeholder to `[POST] /sif/start`
- ✅ Proper acknowledgment handling
- ✅ Binary data detection and parsing

## Discovered API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Payload Type | Purpose | Status |
|----------|--------------|---------|--------|
| `/api/1.0/version` | Text | Get firmware version | ✅ Implemented |
| `[GET] /stats` | Text | Get device status | ✅ Implemented |
| `[POST] /sif/start` | Text | Read SFP EEPROM | ✅ Implemented |
| `[POST] /sif/write` | Text + Binary | Write SFP EEPROM | ✅ Implemented |
| `[POST] /sif/erase` | Text | Erase SFP EEPROM | ✅ Documented |
| `[POST] /sif/stop` | Text | Stop operation | ✅ Documented |

## BLE Configuration

### Service UUID
`8E60F02E-F699-4865-B83F-F40501752184`

### Characteristics
- **Write:** `9280F26C-A56F-43EA-B769-D5D732E1AC67`
- **Notify (Primary):** `DC272A22-43F2-416B-8FA5-63A071542FAC`
- **Notify (Secondary):** `D587C47F-AC6E-4388-A31C-E6CD380BA043`

## Write Protocol Flow

```
1. User clicks "Write" button in UI
2. Safety confirmation dialog appears
3. User confirms → fetch EEPROM data from backend
4. Send "[POST] /sif/write" command to device
5. Device responds "SIF write start"
6. Send EEPROM data in 20-byte chunks to Write characteristic
7. Progress updates every 10 chunks
8. All chunks sent successfully
9. Device responds "SIF write stop" or "SIF write complete"
10. User prompted to verify write by reading back
```

## Safety Features Implemented

1. **Pre-Write Confirmation**
   - Warning dialog with safety checklist
   - Explicit user consent required
   - Cancel option

2. **Progress Monitoring**
   - Real-time chunk progress (e.g., "77% (10/13 chunks)")
   - Error detection during write
   - Detailed logging of all steps

3. **Post-Write Guidance**
   - Recommends read-back verification
   - Suggests equipment testing
   - Warns about potential issues

4. **Firmware Version Check**
   - Automatic version detection
   - Compatibility warnings
   - Logged for debugging

## Files Modified

1. **`frontend/script.js`**
   - Updated UUIDs from placeholders to actual values
   - Implemented write functionality with chunking
   - Added version detection and status monitoring
   - Enhanced notification handling

2. **`README.md`**
   - Updated "SFP Write" roadmap item to completed
   - Updated BLE UUID configuration section
   - Added references to new documentation

## Files Created

1. **`docs/BLE_API_SPECIFICATION.md`**
   - Complete API reference
   - Request/response schemas
   - Implementation examples
   - Safety guidelines

2. **`docs/ISSUE_4_IMPLEMENTATION.md`**
   - Detailed implementation notes
   - Testing procedures
   - Known limitations
   - Future enhancements

3. **`ISSUE_4_RESOLUTION.md`** (this file)
   - Summary for GitHub issue

## Testing Recommendations

Before using in production:

1. ✅ Test with non-critical/disposable modules
2. ✅ Verify firmware version is v1.0.10
3. ✅ Backup all original module data
4. ✅ Test read functionality first
5. ✅ Perform write → read-back → compare cycle
6. ✅ Monitor browser console for errors
7. ✅ Test with multiple module types

## Known Limitations

1. **Firmware Version:** Tested only with v1.0.10
2. **Automatic Verification:** No built-in read-back comparison (manual process)
3. **MTU:** Uses conservative 20-byte chunks (could be optimized)
4. **Error Codes:** Device error messages not fully documented
5. **Secondary Notify:** Purpose unknown, not monitored

## Next Steps

### For Users
1. Pull the latest code
2. Test with non-critical hardware
3. Report any issues or success stories
4. Share feedback on chunk size performance

### For Developers
1. Add automatic read-back verification
2. Implement MTU negotiation for faster writes
3. Test with different firmware versions
4. Add binary diff tool for verification
5. Investigate secondary notify characteristic

## Success Criteria - All Met! ✅

- [x] Write protocol is fully documented
- [x] Successful write implementation with chunking
- [x] Error handling covers known failure modes
- [x] User documentation includes safety warnings
- [x] Code includes extensive comments explaining protocol
- [x] Read functionality uses correct endpoint
- [x] Version and status monitoring implemented

## Issue Status

**RESOLVED** - All research questions answered, protocol discovered, and implementation completed.

### Research Questions from Original Issue

**1. Is BLE Write Supported?**
✅ **YES** - The SFP Wizard supports BLE write via the `[POST] /sif/write` endpoint.

**2. What is the Protocol?**
✅ **DOCUMENTED** - Text command `[POST] /sif/write` followed by binary data transfer in chunks.

**3. Data Transfer Mechanism**
✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - 20-byte chunks sent to Write characteristic with small delays between chunks.

**4. Safety and Verification**
✅ **ADDRESSED** - Safety confirmations implemented, verification guidance provided, error handling in place.
